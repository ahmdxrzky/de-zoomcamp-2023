# Answer for Homework Week 1 Part B

## Question 1
### Init
After downloading and setup GCP, gcloud-sdk, and terraform... <br>
Execute command below on folder that contains [main.tf](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/week1/main.tf) and [variables.tf](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/week1/variables.tf) (I make edit on this file which is change the region to asia-southeast2) files to initialize and install all infrastructure needed:
```
terraform init
```
Output:
```
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "local"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/google...
- Installing hashicorp/google v4.50.0...
- Installed hashicorp/google v4.50.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

### Plan
Then, execute command below for letting terraform see what changes might appear and ask for confirmation:
```
terraform plan
```
Output:
```
var.project
  Your GCP Project ID

  Enter a value: de-zoomcamp-375916


Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)

          + view {

              + project_id = (known after apply)
              + table_id   = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

  # google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket will be created
  + resource "google_storage_bucket" "data-lake-bucket" {

      + project                     = (known after apply)
      + public_access_prevention    = (known after apply)
      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = true
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {

            }

              + age                   = 30
              + matches_prefix        = []

          + not_found_page   = (known after apply)
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

### Apply

```
terraform apply
```
Output:

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creating...
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creating...
google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creation complete after 2s [id=projects/de-zoomcamp-375916/datasets/trips_data_all]
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creation complete after 3s [id=dtc_data_lake_de-zoomcamp-375916]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
