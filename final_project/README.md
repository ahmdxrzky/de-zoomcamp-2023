# Problem Statement
Pattern of weather is getting more difficult to be identified year by year. Usually, Indonesian people could certain that the dry season would occur from March to September and the rainy season on the other hand. Now, we can no longer use this knowledge as reference. Therefore, I am interested to build this project in order to answer the question of _whether there have been changes in weather patterns in Denpasar or not_.

# Data Source
#### [_Denpasar Weather Data on Kaggle_](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cornflake15/denpasarbalihistoricalweatherdata?resource=download) ####
Disclaimer: Actually, dataset above only provides weather data of Denpasar City from 1990 to 2020 (even the data for 2020 is not complete to December). In order to make this data engineering project (which batch processes the data) look real and simulate the actual workflow of data engineering, I _manipulate_ the dataset by _adding_ 4 years to the actual date data and _dividing_ it per year and month, so the data for 2023 are available and can be used to simulate batch processing per month. I put this splitted data [here](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/tree/main/final_project/assets/dataset).

# Project Framework
![assets drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/229009417-e04e2add-29fa-45e3-aa8f-cf094ca23df9.png)
1. Pipeline for processing dataset and extracting it from source to a data lake.
2. Pipeline for batch moving the data from the data lake to a data warehouse.
3. Transform the data in the data warehouse.
4. Create a dashboard to see pattern of weather by year.

- Fill in **target tags** with **network tags** defined previously ("project" for my case), "0.0.0.0/0" on **Source IPv4 ranges** (so all external machine can access this VM), and 4200 on TCP **ports** (port for Prefect UI). Then, click **Create** on bottom of the page.
  ![Screenshot 2023-03-28 053556](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/228082396-ce6819db-415a-42bb-bc11-6997f2ca55e8.png)
- Move to local terminal (I use wsl terminal on Visual Studio Code. This also can be done with command prompt for windows). Check have you generate a SSH key or not by executing this command.
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
  If there is no `id_rsa.pub` file on your machine, it means you haven't generate any SSH key. If there is output from the command above, you can skip this very next step.
- Generate SSH key by executing this command.
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen
  ```
- Read content of `id_rsa.pub` file and copy it.
- Back to **Google Cloud Console**. Go to **VM Instances** tab and click previously built VM instance.

### Setup Environment with Docker
- Install docker on virtual machine.
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
  sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
  ```
- Check project id. <br>
  Personal project id can be seen in google cloud console.
  ![Screenshot 2023-03-29 093459](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/228412084-a15023e3-2fe5-4823-ab0a-614b3a7caf3d.png)
- Environment for this data engineering pipeline has been created and pushed to Image Registry of Docker which is Docker Hub. I've set it publicly accessible, so everyone can create a container based on this Docker Image.
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/229265278-54a15a85-94aa-49f6-8c95-0abe645d316a.png) <br>
  Execute this command below to run docker container based on docker images above.
  ```bash
  docker run -p 4200:4200 -e EXTERNAL_IP=<external-ip> -e PROJECT_ID=<project-id> -it ahmdxrzky/dezoomcamp_final_project:0.0.3
  ```
  Change `<external-ip>` with external IP address of VM instance and `<project-id>` with personal project ID that can be seen in cloud console in the previous step. <br>
    ![Screenshot 2023-04-01 110443](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/229264813-07a4ca3c-ddf7-402e-8c03-843dcdbc7207.png)

  _LOGICAL FRAMEWORK_ <br>
  _I build this docker image based on this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/Dockerfile) which use **Python:3.8** as base image. This image containerize:_
  1. _**Install** sudo and nano_
  2. _**Install Terraform**_
  3. _**Copy** [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/requirements.txt), [data_pipeline.py](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/src/data_pipeline.py), [manipulation_project_id.py](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/src/manipulation_project_id.py), [main.tf](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/terraform/main.tf), and [variables.tf](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/terraform/variables.tf)_
  4. _**Create** config folder_
  5. _**Use** /app folder as working directory_
  6. _**Install** dependency libraries for Python from requirements.txt_
  7. _**Use** bash as entrypoint._

- In container bash terminal, change value of a variable to terraform/variables.tf file by executing command below.
  ```bash
  python3 /app/src/manipulation_project_id.py $PROJECT_ID
  ```
  
  _LOGICAL FRAMEWORK_ <br>
  _Because project id is different for each account, I create [manipulation_project_id.py](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/src/manipulation_project_id.py) that open terraform/variables.tf file and ingest project id of the user as default value of **project** variable. Through this, we can simplify process of open file, replace value, and save file only in a single command execution._
  
- Then, copy contents of keyfile previously downloaded in local machine to config/keyfile.json file in docker container. <br>
  ```bash
  nano /app/config/keyfile.json
  ```
  ![Screenshot 2023-03-28 060521](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/228086639-eb88867c-22cb-4afa-8cd2-336c0d6ec04d.png)
- Run terraform to create GCS Bucket and GBQ Dataset with single execution.
  ```bash
  cd /app/terraform \
    && terraform init \
    && terraform plan \
    && terraform apply -auto-approve
  ```
  
  _LOGICAL FRAMEWORK_ <br>
  1. _**Terraform**, as Iac Tool, creates infrastructures by read these two files, [main.tf](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/terraform/main.tf) and [variables.tf](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/terraform/variables.tf)_
  2. _**variables.tf** file contains definition (name, description, default value, and data type) of variables that will be used in main.tf file. In this project, I created **data_lake_bucket**, **project**, **region**, **credentials**, **storage_class**, and **BQ_DATASET** variables which contain value of name for GCS Bucket, personal project id, region for resource, path to service account keyfile, storage class, and name for GBQ Dataset, respectively._
  3. _**main.tf** file contains codes to build GCS Bucket and GBQ Dataset based on variables on variables.tf file._

### Activate and Configurate Prefect
- Activate and Access Prefect UI.
  ```bash
  prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://$EXTERNAL_IP:4200/api
  prefect server start --host 0.0.0.0
  ```
  Now, Prefect UI can be accessed from web browser with URL `<external-ip>:4200`.

  Fill `gcs-bucket-final-project` for the block on **Block Name**, `dezoomcamp_final_project` on **Bucket**, and choose which GCP Credentials embedded with the bucket on **Gcp Credentials**. Then, click **Create**. <br>
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/228090227-34a9c702-6468-4979-871d-12bea89a86f8.png)
- Open new terminal and access vm in the new terminal using ssh (same as before). Access same container by checking its id and run with exec command.
  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```
  Remember CONTAINER ID of the container. This id will be used to access its bash terminal.
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <container-id> bash
  ```
  Replace `<container-id>` with CONTAINER ID above.
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/229264890-4972df8c-5e71-466d-91ba-0caa46acae3d.png)

## Create, Apply, and Run Prefect Deployment
- To create and apply Prefect Deployment and set the cron to run monthly, execute this command.
  ```bash
  prefect deployment build /app/src/data_pipeline.py:etl_main_function -n "ETL_GCS_to_BGQ_Monthly" --cron "0 0 1 * *" -a
  ```
  A Deployment (as same as job being scheduled) has been built and will be run monthly at 1st day of the month.
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/228199147-79b85c4e-5b77-4b7e-89fe-0a1e0889d3e0.png) <br>
  
  _LOGICAL FRAMEWORK_ <br>
  _I've created [data_pipeline.py](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/de-zoomcamp-2023/blob/main/final_project/src/data_pipeline.py) that contains data pipeline consists of: A flow, a subflow, two subsubflows with 3 tasks in each subsubflow._
  1. _A flow called **etl_main_function** that accepts 3 params, which means this flow is parameterized. It will ingest initial dataset or ingest previous month data depends on value of **initial** param._
  2. _A sub flow called **etl_for_a_month** that accepts 2 param (year and month) and handles ingest process of a file of data per month._
  3. _Two subsubflows called **etl_ingest_to_data_lake** and **etl_ingest_to_data_warehouse**. **etl_ingest_to_data_lake** subsubflow consists of 3 tasks, which are **extract_from_source** (Read csv file as dataframe), **write_parquet_to_local** (Transform dataframe to parquet file), and **write_parquet_to_gcs** (Upload parquet file to Data Lake). **etl_ingest_to_data_warehouse** subsubflow consists of 3 tasks too, which are **extract_from_gcs** (Download parquet files from Data Lake), **read_parquet_as_dataframe** (Read parquet file as dataframe), and **write_dataframe_to_gbq** (Ingest dataframe to Data Warehouse)._
  
- Do quick run to ingest initial dataset (Jan 2015 to Feb 2023), since March 1st, 2023 has already passed.
  ```bash
  prefect deployment run etl-main-function/ETL_GCS_to_BGQ_Monthly --param initial=True
  ```
- Don't forget to start a Prefect Agent for the deployment by executing command below:
  ```bash
  prefect agent start -q 'default'
  ```
  By executing command above, quick run to ingest initial dataset will run. BigQuery will start to store dataset from Jan 2015 to Feb 2023.

  You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/dbt-cloud-data-transformation) and choose this repository in **Setup a Repository** part. <br>
- Go to **Develop** tab. Execute this command on dbt terminal.
  ```bash
  dbt seed
  dbt run
  ```
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/228480443-2c7144ca-ea66-4019-9c5f-69b07fd22ce9.png)
  If it run well, then we can proceed to Deployment.
- Drop down **Deploy** and click **Environments**.
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/228686465-38acffd4-5d10-488b-8fa0-54548dbdd1b8.png)
- Click **Create Environment**. Because development environment has been already built, we can only create deployment environment. Fill in **Name** as name for this deployment environment and **Dataset** as name of dataset that will be used as final data warehouse after data transformation and used for visualization.
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99194827/228686925-c3a376cd-15f1-4835-b667-6161a6631c80.png)

  _LOGICAL FRAMEWORK_ <br>
  1. _**dbt** initiates a folder as data modelling schema by creating folders. It uses external file as data source for table if the file is being put in **seeds** folder. It also creates models if the models' schema are defined in **models** folder._
  2. _I use [weather_lookup.csv](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/dbt-cloud-data-transformation/blob/main/seeds/weather_lookup.csv) as seed file. It contains weather id used in weather data that corresponds with its weather name and description._
  3. _I define two kinds of model schema, which are **staging** and **facts**._
  4. _I define a [staging model](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/dbt-cloud-data-transformation/blob/main/models/staging/stg_weather_data.sql) as **view** in GBQ. It takes several columns from partitioned **all_weather_data** table and converts their data types._
  5. _I define a [**dimensional table**](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/dbt-cloud-data-transformation/blob/main/models/facts/dim_weather.sql) from seed file._
  6. _I define a [**fact table**](https://github.com/ahmdxrzky/dbt-cloud-data-transformation/blob/main/models/facts/fact_weather.sql) which join weather data with dimensional table based on weather_id._

  _LOGICAL FRAMEWORK_ <br>
  1. _The first visualization is created using three columns. I use **record_datetime** as filter, **record_month** as x-axis, and count of **weather_category** per month as y-axis. I also use **weather_category** itself as detail dimension._
  2. _The second visualization is created using two columns. I use **record_datetime** as filter and x-axis also average of **temperature** on a day as y-axis._

# Insights and Goals Fulfilling
A data pipeline of Denpasar Weather Data from data source to dashboard has been **created**. From visualization of data, it can be clearly seen that month with highest total of rainy day is **January** and the lowest is **October**, where October is assumed as **rainy** season. Therefore, I strongly believe that there is a **shift** in weather patternal in Denpasar.
